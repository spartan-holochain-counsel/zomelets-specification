# Zomelet Specification
Consists of 2 interface types

1. Zomelet - *an interface that maps to a single coordinator zome*
2. Cell Zomelets - *a map of interfaces for multiple coordinator zomes*

**NOTE:** The examples cannot illustrate how to use the defined Zomelets because usage depends on
the zomelet-compatible client you are using.  See our client implementation
([`@spartan-hc/app-interface-client`](https://github.com/spartan-holochain-counsel/app-interface-client-js))
for an understanding of how Zomelets can be used in a client.
